							<h2>Artfinder</h2>
							<p class="subheader">2010 - 2017</p>
							<p class="tools">UX, UI, Product management</p>
							<p class="description">Artfinder is the world's largest online marketplace for original art. With over 10,000 artists and customers around the world, Artfinder is disrupting the high end art market to bring affordable, original art to the masses.</p>
							<p class="description">As Product Manager and lead UX/UI designer I worked closely with a team of developers to define the product roadmap and design solutions our artist and customers would love.</p>
							<p class="subheader">2011: The early days (going appy!)</p>
							<p class="description">When Artfinder launched in 2011 the business model was radically different. As a content site with no eCommerce functionality, we partnered with galleries around the world to create an online database of art. We had a responsive website and iOS app, which was featured by Apple as one of their top new apps. This app used image recnogition technology to allow you to recognise a painting in a gallery and find out more information.</p>
							<p class="description">During this time, I worked closely with the development and design teams to build and iterate wireframes for the app and produce brand appropriate copy and content. We found that the onboarding flow was key in encouraging users to sign up to Artfinder, a important source of lead generation for the business. We used user feedback to make iterative improvements to the app, such as improving load time and integrating our Art of the Day feature, with daily push notifcatins to alert the user to the daily artwork.</p>
							<p class="subheader">2013: Time to pivot!</p>
							<p class="description">In 2013 Artfinder pivoted to an eCommerce business model. It was an exciting time for the business; we had to work fast and change our way of thinking drastically. The site went through several iterations as we figured out what our customers and artists wanted. During this time I established processes for product management and user experience design which allowed the business to scale and grow.</p>
							<p class="subheader">2015: Discovery over search</p>
							<p class="description">The art market is like no other. Traditionally high end and reticent to move online, it's alien to the masses. So much anxiety surrounds buying art, so we had to take the opportunity to bust the myths about buying art. Through extensive research and testing, we learned that our customers rarely knew exactly what they wanted. We needed to deviate from a classic eCommerce user experience and focus on personalisation. We developed a system for recommeding artworks based on collaborative filtering, and began to adapt the user experience to focus on art 'discovery' over traditional search. Our aim was to foster a relationship with our users, help them discover their art taste, and make them feel comfortable buying art for the first time. This new focus is what differentiated Artfinder from its competitors and allowed us to stand out.</p>

							<p class="subheader">2016: Time for a rebrand</p>
							<p class="description">In 2016 Artfinder worked with London-based agency <a href="https://www.wearedesignstudio.com/" target="_blank">Design Studio</a> on a complete rebrand. Once the new brand guidelines were finalised we had only 4 months to completely redevelop the website, our emails, social channels and all collateral. I collaborated with the team at Design Studio out of their office to redesign the website according to their new guidelines. It was an exciting period, one which required close attention to detail (so as to not butcher the new brand!) balanced with fast action. I established a process of priority for redesigning the website, and with our lead front-end developer built a development style guide that allowed the developers to quickly update the website's base styling and rebuild key pages from scratch.</p>
							<p class="subheader">My process</p>
							<p class="description">My process was user-centric, using insight collected from user testing, focus groups, direct feedback and data analysis to determine the product evolution. From this initial ideation phase, each project was then passed through rigorous UX exercises, where user flows, wireframes and prototypes were iterated upon before UI design and technical specs were polished off.</p>

						</div>
						<div class="portfolio-content">
							<p class="subheader">Highlights</p>
							<p class="description">With a flair for both iterative optimisation and â€˜big pictureâ€™ thinking, achievements include introducing AB testing, device-specific analysis and usability testing as core processes, integrating personalisation into the UX, and redesigning the search interface, checkout flow and navigation. I developed several new features end to end, including in-context visualisation and framing.</p>
							<p class="description">Through active participation in sprint planning, daily tech standups and QA reviews, Iâ€™ve developed good technical awareness and learn fast. Skilled at leading group brainstorm sessions, I brought momentum to every project I was involved in and successfully established a cross-departmental â€˜tribeâ€™ culture. A core member of Artfinder since its birth, Iâ€™m proud to have seen it grow from nothing to become the worldâ€™s largest original art marketplace with 10,000 artists.</p>
