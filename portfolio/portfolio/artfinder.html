				<h2>Artfinder</h2>
				<h4>UX, UI, Product Management</h4>
				<p class="description">Artfinder is the world's largest online marketplace for original art. With over 10,000 artists and customers around the world, Artfinder is disrupting the high end art market to bring affordable, original art to the masses. With a strong mission statement, the brand is bold and unapologetic.</p>
				<p class="description">As Product Manager and lead UX/UI designer at Artfinder, I worked closely with a team of developers to shape the product roadmap and design solutions our artist and customers would love.</p>
				<p class="subheader">The early days: going appy</p>
				<p class="description">When Artfinder launched in 2011 the business model was radically different. As a content site with no eCommerce functionality, we partnered with galleries around the world to create an online database of art. We had a responsive website and iOS app, which was featured by Apple as one of their top new apps. This app featured our image recnogition technology, which could be used in a gallery or museum to recognise a painting and tell you more about it.</p>
				<p class="description">During this time, I worked closely with the development and design teams to build and iterate wireframes for the app and produce brand appropriate copy and content. We found the onboarding flow particuly important to encourage users to sign up to Artfinder, a key source of lead generation for the business. We used user feedback to make key improvements to the app, such as improving load time and integrating one of our key campaigns, Art of the Day, with daily push notifcatins to alert the user to that day's featured artwork.</p>
				<p class="subheader">Pivot!</p>
				<p class="description">In 2013 Artfinder pivoted to an eCommerce business model. It was an exciting time for the business; we had to work fast and change our way of thinking. The site went through several iterations as we figured out what our customers and artists wanted. During this time I established processes for product management and user experience design for the first time which allowed the business to scale and grow.</p>
				<p class="subheader">Discovery over search</p>
				<p class="description">The art market is like no other. Traditionally high end and reticent to move online, it's alien to the masses. So much anxiety surrounds buying art, and moving this market online and shifting the focus to the mass market was a key opportunity to challenge the myths about buying art. Through extensive research and testing, we learned that our customers rarely knew exactly what they wanted. We needed to deviate from a classic eCommerce user experience and focus on personalisation. We developed a system for recommeding artworks to a user based on collaborative filtering, and began to adapt the user experience to focus on art discovery rather than traditional search and filter. Our aim was to foster a relationship with our users, help them discover their art taste, and make them feel comfortable buying art for the first time. This focus is what differentiates Artfinder from its competitors.</p>
				<p class="subheader">Rebrand</p>
				<p class="description">In 2016 Artfinder worked with London-based agency Design Studio on a complete rebrand. Time was of the essence, and once the new brand guidelines were finalised we had only 4 months to completely redevelop the website, our emails, social channels and all collateral. I collaborated with the team at Design Studio out of their office to redesign the website according to their new guidelines. It was an exciting period, one which required close attention to detail (so as to not butcher the new brand!) balanced with fast action. I established a process of priority for redesigning the website, and with our lead Front-end developer built a development style guide that allowed the developers to quickly update the website's base styling and rebuild key pages from scratch.</p>
				<p class="subheader">My process</p>
				<p class="description">My process was user-centric, using insight collected from user testing, focus groups, direct feedback and data analysis to influence and shape the product evolution to best respond to our users' needs and their unique chellenges.</p>
				<p class="description">From this initial ideation phase, each project was then passed through rigorous UX exercises, where user flows, wireframes and prototypes were iterated upon before UI design and technical specs were polished off.</p>
				<p class="subheader">Highlights</p>
				<p class="description">With a flair for both iterative optimisation and ‘big picture’ thinking, achievements include introducing AB testing and usability testing as core processes, integrating personalisation into the UX, redesigning the search interface, checkout flow and navigation, and developing key features such as framing, commissions and in-context visualisation. I also managed a total rebrand over a four month period.</p>
				<p class="description">Through active participation in sprint planning and PR reviews, I’ve developed good technical awareness and learn fast. Skilled at leading group brainstorms to kick-start ideas, I brought momentum to every project I was involved in and successfully established a cross-departmental ‘tribe’ culture.</p>
				<p class="description">A core member of Artfinder since its birth, I’m proud to have seen it grow from nothing to become the world’s largest original art marketplace with 10,000 artists.</p>
