								<p>This site showcases large images with bold typography, using ample whitespace to draw attention to the visuals and headlines. A minimal colour palette compliments this clean layout, whilst the smooth interactive scrolling makes the experience playful.
									<br><br>Typography: Good contrast is created between the titles and body copy with large and small font sizes and dark and lighter font colours. Sub-titles are then called out with smaller, but uppercase font. This contrast helps create hierarchy, which aids flow.
										<br><br>Navigation + Flow: As someone who had never visited the site before I found the overall navigation a little difficult. I was unsure whether the main action should be scrolling down, cliking on the main nav, or on the side nav. Each link on the top nav houses its own unique content, and I think that the site layout would become more intuitive if the top nav either linked directly to content already present on the main page, or if there wasn't such a long vertical scroll on the homepage. 
											<br><br>Furthermore, when scrolling downwards I felt there were too many types of scrolls and intractivity on this page; on one section the images and text flip within one computer screen; on another they appear asymmetrically as you scroll downwards. I think these different effects can distract from the overall site objective to convert new users into subscribers.
												<br><br>Having said that, I think that because the design is so clean - the designer can have a little more flair with the navigation. The large images and titles and ample whitespace help punctuate and guide the eye downwards, creating a sense of flow. 
													<br><br>I like that the main cta jumps to the nav as you scroll, as it reminds the users what the one core action of that site is: to get started. It makes it clear that this site is a service, not a portfolio site.

							<p>I love the way the navigation mirrors the centre graphic. It draws the user's eye in and makes it an interactive experience. I would love to see some pseudo-class applied to each nav link when hovered over to amplify this playful experience.
								<br><br>I also love how the background image creates a skeumorphic effect - I really do believe I'm in outer space!
									<br><br>Typography: the nav's readability would be improved with larger font size and increased letter spacing. Furthermore, the links are too close to the images - increasing margins here would really aid overall comprehension. Furthermore, I think the red footer text doesn't compliment with the yellow link colour.
									<br><br>Overall there is little to no structure on this page - which is perhaps the point, as every element feels like it's floating around in space. Anchoring the page with a top nav bar and final footer bar would make it easier to read through the nav links from left to right, rather than round in circles. Some additional content on the homepage would also aid the flow and provide some clarity as to what the site's main purpose is.
										<br><br>The layout and styling of each page is completely different, there is a real lack of consistency which makes it hard to understand where in the site you are. At one point you even seem to be on a completely different site! Having a consistent header and nav across all pages would improve the site nagivation.
