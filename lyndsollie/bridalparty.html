							<p>Best known for: Bargains<br><br>Bio: True Yorkshireman, Mick, loves nothing more than finding a good bargain and letting all the family know about it. The family are slightly concerned that now he’s retired however, things might get out of hand and they’ll one-day flick on the TV and see him crop up on popular TV show ‘Bargain Hunt’.</p>

Don’t try to outsmart her – resistance is futile. We’re lucky that she’s reading Harry Potter so that we can finally get on the same level. </p>

							<p>Knows Lyndsay from: Birth<br>Best known for: Being responsible for Lyndsay’s eclectic fashion sense.<br><br>Bio: As an adolescent, Dawn – along with middle sibling Neil -  used to believe Lynds was her own personal mannequin and backing dancer. She consequently dressed her up in outrageous eighties night out attire (most of which is now only available on the Black Market in dodgy parts of Berlin) and brainwashed her into believing that Michael Jackson, Kylie and Madonna were the only people to base all fashion related decisions upon. Years later, Lynds is still battling to overcome this unfortunate period.</p>
